          Joel & Co. takes pride in quality craftsmanship, attention to detail,
          and provides full and open communication with each and every client.
          With each project, it is understood that this is not about simply
          putting up walls or tile â€” it is about manifesting the vision of the
          client and keeping that vision the central focus throughout the
          construction process. For these reasons, the company is among the most
          trusted and fastest-growing renovation specialists and custom home
          builders in Los Angeles.
