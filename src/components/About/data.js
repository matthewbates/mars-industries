Located in the historic Barker House, we’re proud to offer the ONLY outdoor, covered patio with views in the area. Owner and Chef, Lyman Anderson, spent over two decades working in local restaurants within Old Colorado City and Manitou Springs designing and testing his recipes and perfecting his craft, all while learning the ins and outs of the restaurant industry. When the opportunity presented itself, Lyman grabbed it with two hands and Persephone Grae’s Cafe & Juice Bar was formed.",
